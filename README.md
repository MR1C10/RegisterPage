# Register Page

This project aims to create a registration page.

## Objectives

I am developing this registration web page to:

- Practice using databases;

- Enhance my knowledge of ASP.NET;

- Create a more elaborate and professional interface than those in my previous projects.

## Planned Features

- Data Validation: Implement client-side and server-side validation;

- Database Integration: Securely store user data;

- Responsive Design: Ensure compatibility with various devices;

- Improved Usability: Provide visual feedback such as error messages and confirmations.

# Final Considerations

I am applying best practices in design and development to ensure an intuitive and functional user experience. If any additional ideas or suggestions arise, I am open to implementing them!
